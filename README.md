Python-Final-Project

To start off I am very disaapointed in myself of this project because I know I could have done better. There were a lot of obstcales that I came across when doing this final project that prevent me from achieving my goal. The first and biggest obstical was installing and making sure LOVE could run. I spent a massive amount of time trying to figure out what was wrong wasting many hours. In the end when i finally figured it out i was relieved but i already wasted so much time i couldve been using to work on the project. The problem was the code editor itself IDLE did not work with LOVE so i had to download a new code editor. The other issues that i had were the code itself although i was following a tutorial i made very minor mistakes within the code which took me a lot of time to figure out what was wrong and why it was not running. I attemped to code one of the powerups that i intended to do in the first place but ended up failing over and over again. The game itself was also coded in a different language that i was not familiar with, that was one of the reasons why i struggled to code in the things what i wanted. One of the things that I leanred was that even the smallest error could make the entire could just not run and it frustrated me so much. Although there was alot of struggle and frustration while doing this project i did enjoy it because in the end i actually got to learn how to code a working videogame that i could play myself.
